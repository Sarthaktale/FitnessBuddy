    # Introduction to Bodybuilding
    st.markdown("""
    Bodybuilding is not just about lifting weights—it's about developing strength, muscle mass, and aesthetic physique through a combination of intense training, nutrition, recovery, and the right mindset. Whether you are a beginner or have been training for a while, becoming an enhanced bodybuilder requires dedication and smart strategies.

    In this guide, we will cover:
    - **Training Principles**

    # Training Principles
    st.header("1. Training Principles")
    st.markdown("""
    To build muscle, you need a structured and progressive training routine that targets all major muscle groups. Here are some important principles to follow:

    ### Progressive Overload
    - **What it is**: Gradually increasing the intensity of your workouts by increasing weight, reps, or sets over time.
    - **Why it's important**: Progressive overload stimulates muscle growth by continually challenging your muscles, preventing plateaus.

    ### Compound Movements
    - **What it is**: Exercises that target multiple muscle groups at once, such as squats, deadlifts, and bench presses.
    - **Why it's important**: Compound movements allow you to lift heavier weights and recruit more muscle fibers, leading to greater overall muscle development.

    ### Isolation Exercises
    - **What it is**: Exercises that target a single muscle group, such as bicep curls and leg extensions.
    - **Why it's important**: Isolation exercises help target specific muscles for more detailed muscle development and improve symmetry.

    ### Training Split
    - **Push-Pull-Legs Split**: A classic bodybuilding split where you train push muscles (chest, shoulders, triceps), pull muscles (back, biceps), and legs on separate days.
    - **Upper-Lower Split**: Alternate between upper body and lower body workouts for balanced training.

    ### Intensity and Volume
    - **What it is**: Intensity refers to the effort put into each set (typically expressed in terms of weight lifted), and volume refers to the total amount of work done (sets x reps).
    - **Why it's important**: The combination of high intensity and high volume is crucial for muscle hypertrophy (growth).

    ### Rest and Recovery Between Sets
    - Rest times between sets should be around 60-90 seconds for hypertrophy. Longer rest periods (2-3 minutes) are ideal for strength-focused lifts.

    # Nutrition for Enhanced Bodybuilding
    st.header("2. Nutrition")
    st.markdown ("""
    Nutrition plays a vital role in muscle building. To gain muscle, you need to be in a **caloric surplus**, meaning you consume more calories than you burn. Here's what to focus on:

    ### Protein Intake
    - **What it is**: Protein is the building block of muscle tissue.
    - **How much**: Aim for at least **1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight**.
    - **Sources**: Chicken, fish, eggs, lean beef, tofu, lentils, quinoa, protein powders.

    ### Carbohydrates for Energy
    - **What it is**: Carbs provide the energy you need for intense training.
    - **How much**: Carbs should make up the majority of your calories. Aim for **3-6 grams of carbs per kilogram of body weight**.
    - **Sources**: Rice, oats, potatoes, sweet potatoes, whole grains, fruits.

    ### Healthy Fats
    - **What it is**: Fats are essential for hormone production and overall health.
    - **How much**: Aim for **0.8-1.0 grams of fat per kilogram of body weight**.
    - **Sources**: Avocados, olive oil, nuts, seeds, fatty fish.

    ### Micronutrients and Hydration
    - **Vitamins and Minerals**: Ensure a well-rounded diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole foods to support overall health and muscle function.
    - **Water**: Stay hydrated! Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially during and after workouts.

    ### Meal Timing
    - **Pre-Workout**: Eat a balanced meal with carbs and protein 1-2 hours before training.
    - **Post-Workout**: Consume a high-protein meal or shake immediately after your workout to support recovery.
    - **Meal Frequency**: Aim for 4-6 meals throughout the day to maintain a steady supply of nutrients to the muscles.

    # Supplements for Enhanced Muscle Growth
    st.header("3. Supplements")
    st.markdown("""
    While supplements are not necessary for everyone, they can help enhance performance and muscle growth. Some popular and effective bodybuilding supplements include:

    ### Protein Powder
    - **Why**: To ensure you meet your daily protein requirements.
    - **When**: Take it post-workout or as a meal replacement if you're unable to get enough protein from whole foods.

    ### Creatine Monohydrate
    - **Why**: Creatine helps improve strength, power output, and muscle recovery.
    - **When**: Take 5 grams daily, preferably post-workout.

    ### Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)
    - **Why**: BCAAs help with muscle recovery and reduce muscle soreness.
    - **When**: Consume during your workout or post-workout.

    ### Pre-Workout Supplements
    - **Why**: These often contain caffeine, beta-alanine, and nitric oxide boosters to increase energy, focus, and endurance during your workout.
    - **When**: Take 30 minutes before your workout.

    ### Fish Oil (Omega-3)
    - **Why**: Supports heart health, reduces inflammation, and helps with muscle recovery.
    - **When**: Take 1-2 grams daily with meals.

    ### Multivitamins
    - **Why**: Ensure you're getting all essential micronutrients to support overall health.
    - **When**: Take once daily with meals.""")

    # Recovery Strategies
    st.header("4. Recovery")
    st.markdown("""
    Building muscle isn't just about the workout; it's equally about recovery. Without adequate recovery, you cannot achieve optimal muscle growth.

    ### Sleep
    - **Why**: Muscle recovery and growth occur during sleep due to the release of growth hormones.
    - **How much**: Aim for **7-9 hours of sleep** per night.

    ### Active Recovery
    - **Why**: Helps reduce muscle soreness and improve circulation.
    - **How**: Perform light activities like walking, stretching, or yoga on rest days.

    ### Stretching
    - **Why**: Improves flexibility, reduces tightness, and aids in injury prevention.
    - **How**: Incorporate dynamic stretching before workouts and static stretching post-workout.

    ### Foam Rolling
    - **Why**: Helps release muscle knots, improve mobility, and speed up recovery.
    - **How**: Use a foam roller on tight or sore muscles for 5-10 minutes daily.

    # Mindset for Success
    st.header("5. Mindset for Success")
    st.markdown("""
    Your mindset is a crucial aspect of becoming a successful bodybuilder. It’s important to stay disciplined and focused on long-term goals.

    ### Set Clear Goals
    - **What**: Write down your goals, whether it’s increasing strength, gaining muscle mass, or improving aesthetics.
    - **How**: Break down long-term goals into short-term achievable targets.

    ### Stay Consistent
    - **Why**: Consistency is key to seeing progress. Follow your training and nutrition plan consistently to achieve muscle growth.
    - **How**: Track your workouts, meals, and progress to stay on track.

    ### Patience
    - **Why**: Muscle building is a slow and steady process. Don’t expect drastic changes overnight.
    - **How**: Focus on incremental improvements, and trust the process.

    ### Positive Attitude
    - **Why**: A positive attitude helps you stay motivated and push through challenging workouts.
    - **How**: Surround yourself with supportive individuals and stay committed to your goals.
